# Classes

# multiple inheritance possible
# derived class can override any base class method
# classes are created at runtime

# built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user

# class members are PUBLIC by default
# member functions are VIRTUAL by default



# Pseudo Pointers

# Multiple names can be bound to the same object, aka aliasing in other
# languages. With mutable objects, aliases behave like pointers in some
# respects.

# Passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the
# implementation; and if a function modifies an object passed as an
# argument, the caller will see the change â€” this eliminates the need
# for two different argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.

# "the caller will see the change" - ?



# Namespaces

# a namespace is a mapping from names to objects

# they are implemented as dictionaries in python

# there is no relation between names in different namespaces!
# eg 2 modules may define maximise() - no confusion since python
# requires to prefix by module name

# the namespace containing all built-in names is created when python
# interpreter starts up, and is never deleted

# a module's namespace is created when module is imported, and is
# usually deleted when interpreter quits.

# namespace examples: built-in variable names, variable names local to
# a module, variable names local to the body of a function
